# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches to fix security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our authentication service seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
3. **Secure configuration**: Use strong, unique secrets and keys
4. **Monitor logs**: Regularly review application logs for suspicious activity
5. **Regular backups**: Maintain regular backups of your database

### For Contributors

1. **Security review**: All code changes undergo security review
2. **Dependency scanning**: We use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Static analysis**: Code is analyzed for security issues before merging
4. **Testing**: Security-related tests are included in our test suite

## Security Measures

Our authentication service implements several security measures:

- **JWT tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Password hashing**: Bcrypt-based password hashing with configurable cost
- **Rate limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks (handled by external service)
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **SQL injection protection**: Parameterized queries using sqlc
- **CORS protection**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **HTTPS enforcement**: TLS/SSL encryption for all communications
- **Secure headers**: Implementation of security headers
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions with the fixes
5. Notify users of the security update

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked as security releases in the changelog.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to respond to issues before any disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data without explicit permission
- Avoid actions that could negatively impact other users' experience
- Not attempt to gain access to other users' accounts or data
